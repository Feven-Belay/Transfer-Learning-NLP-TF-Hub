# Transfer Learning for NLP with TensorFlow Hub

## Project Overview
This project focuses on utilizing transfer learning for natural language processing tasks using TensorFlow Hub's pre-trained models. The goal is to leverage these advanced models to understand and classify text data efficiently. This approach allows us to benefit from models trained on large datasets without the need for extensive computational resources.

## Features
- Utilization of TensorFlow Hub for loading pre-trained NLP models.
- Implementation of transfer learning techniques to fine-tune models on a specific NLP task.
- Evaluation of model performance using accuracy metrics and visualization with TensorBoard.
